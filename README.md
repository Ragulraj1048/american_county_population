I spearheaded a detailed analysis of County-level Population growth in the United States spanning the years 1970 to 2014, employing Power BI for robust visualization and strategic insights. The project involved meticulous data collection from diverse sources including the National Bureau of Economic Research and GitHub repositories. Utilizing Power Query Editor, I navigated complex data cleaning challenges, ensuring utmost accuracy and data quality. The transformation process included merging columns for a cohesive database and calculating precise population growth rates.

With a focus on interactivity, I developed dynamic dashboards in Power BI that vividly portrayed county-level population trends. The dashboards facilitated nuanced trend analysis, enabling the identification of counties with consistent growth, decline, or fluctuations over the studied period. Leveraging forecasting models, I also provided foresight into potential future population trends. This project not only showcased my proficiency in data analytics but also highlighted my ability to navigate intricate datasets, ensuring a comprehensive and insightful exploration of demographic patterns.
